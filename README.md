# Readable API Server

This is the starter project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux
course where you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to
post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users'
posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and
delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that you'll use to
develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

## How to get started

To get started right away:

* Start the API server
  * `cd api-server`
  * `yarn add` or `npm install`
  * `yarn start` or `npm start` or `node server`
* In another terminal window, start the front-end website using
  * `cd frontend`
  * `yarn start` or `npm start`
